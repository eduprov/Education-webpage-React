                       <b> Best Distance Education in Bangalore </b> Distance education can be defined as 
                        the education of students that does  not necessitate the physical presence of 
                        students at the place viz.  school. It is also termed as distance learning. 
                        It is a remote way of  learning that does not require face-to-face interaction 
                        with the instructor. At an undergraduate level, distance learning usually means 
                        students engaging  with learning materials at home or work. These materials are 
                        produced by the  university, college or learning provider and are either sent 
                        directly to the  student or more usually today accessed via the internet.

                        <b>What are the cons of distance education?</b> Every coin has two faces. So does 
                        distance learning have? It cannot be said as a straightforward disadvantage,
                         but it depends upon how the negligence of any student can prove distance 
                         education as disadvantageous to him. Some are: It requires self-motivation, 
                         it is isolated, does not give direct access to the instructor, it must be 
                         accredited, it does not allow students to work on their oral communication 
                         skills. But with the multi-purpose, evolving of people and their dire desire 
                         to achieve so much in so little time, people are running short of time and 
                         need to opt for distance education to propel their future. So, it can be seen 
                          a blessing in disguise.

                       <b> Distance learning </b>has seen a surge in the number of students enrolled and 
                        also the number of institutes providing the same. India alone has crossed 
                        the 10 million mark. Why consider distance education when you have a regular
                        mode of education? Although considered the distorted form of regular
                        education, distance education is a blessing to those who want to study 
                        and work together or the ones who cannot go to campuses for any reason. 
                        The value of distance learning has often been raising eyebrows at. But the 
                        value of the mode of education relies solely on the student. Some find this 
                        mode way better than its counterpart, whereas others struggle to cope with 
                        this mode. Some advantages can be listed as follows: it provides flexibility
                        in working hours saves money, saves time and energy, convenient, 24 hours 
                        access to study materials, any topic at any time.
